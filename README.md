# American-Community-Survey-Data-Analysis

1. Data Summary
The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survery that is conducted every year in the US. It provides data about the economic, social, demographic, and housing 
charactersistics of the US population. I choose to analyse population characteristics from the ACS data set, I thought it would be interesting to compare people from different races and compare people within a particular race. Some of the columns that I picked are Age, Sex, Marital Status, Ability to speak English, Educational qualifications, 
Race(RAC1P first race entry and RAC2P second race entry), Income, Language spoken at home and type of Citizenship.
