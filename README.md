1. Data Summary
I choose to analyse population characteristics from the ACS data set, I thought it would be interesting to compare people from different races and compare people 
within a particular race. Some of the columns that I picked are Age, Sex, Marital Status, Ability to speak English, Educational qualifications, 
Race(RAC1P first race entry and RAC2P second race entry), Income, Language spoken at home and type of Citizenship.
