# American-Community-Survey-Data-Analysis

In this project the American Community Survey data was analyzed using R.

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survery that is conducted every year in the US. It provides data about the economic, social, demographic, and housing 
charactersistics of the US population. I choose to analyse population characteristics from the ACS data set, I thought it would be interesting to compare people from different races and compare people within a particular race.

The project was divided into 3 parts:

**1. Data Preprocesing**
**2. Data Summary**
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis**
**4. Model**
