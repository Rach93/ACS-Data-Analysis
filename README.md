The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survery that is conducted every year in the US. It provides data about the economic, social, demographic, and housing 
charactersistics of the US population. I choose to analyse population characteristics from the ACS data set. 

The project was divided into 4 parts:

**1. Data Preprocesing**: Categorical variables such as gender, citizenship, states etc. were converted into factors. Adjustment variable was included to account for inflation.
